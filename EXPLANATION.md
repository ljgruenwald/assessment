Run example code: yarn start

Any noteworthy logic/style decisions you made?

    I added more information for each node to track. Adding the 
    corresponding boss node to each node makes our functions 
    simpler to implement. 

If you had more time, what improvements would you implement?

    I would take more time to ensure I am covering as many edge cases
    as possible and do more testing. I would also reuse more code. 
    For example, Demotions and Promotions require a lot of the same logic. 

Bonus: What is the time complexity of each function in your code?

    coming soon!

Bonus: There are two functions that have very similar logic and could be 
merged into one. Which functions do you think can be merged and why?

    Promotions and Demotions. They both swap two nodes.
